# 🏠 House Price Prediction — Machine Learning Project

## 📘 Introduction
Accurately predicting house prices is a classic and practical problem in the field of machine learning.  
Real estate prices depend on a variety of factors such as location, number of rooms, area, neighborhood quality, and more.  

This project aims to build a **predictive model** that can estimate the selling price of a house based on key features provided in a structured dataset.  
It is based on the **Kaggle "House Prices — Advanced Regression Techniques"** competition.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand key factors influencing prices.  
- Handle **missing data**, **outliers**, and **categorical variables** effectively.  
- Apply **feature engineering** techniques to improve model accuracy.  
- Train and compare multiple **regression algorithms** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
- Evaluate model performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **cross-validation**.

## 🔍 Dataset Overview
- **Source:** [Kaggle: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)  
- **Train Data:** 1460 rows × 81 columns  
- **Test Data:** 1459 rows × 80 columns  
- **Target Variable:** `SalePrice`

## 📈 Approach
1. **Data Cleaning** — Handle null values, fix datatypes, remove noise.  
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** — Visualize correlations between features and sale price.  
3. **Feature Engineering** — Encode categorical variables, create derived features, and normalize data.  
4. **Model Building** — Train various regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, RandomForest, XGBoost).  
5. **Model Evaluation** — Compare results using RMSE, cross-validation, and learning curves.  
6. **Prediction & Submission** — Generate predictions for the test set and create the Kaggle submission file.
